## Refresher on Next Generation JavaScript
- 

## The Basics
- React is a Javascript library used to make the creation and maintanance of UIs easier. JS applications, because they run entirely on the browser, are fast.
- alternatives incl. Angular and Vue
- It's structured to use on components that can include repeatable HTML code

- there are two kinds of applications
    - *single-page application* = there is only one HTML page, all content is (re)rendered as components, keeping all function calls in one variable (app, root, etc.) and have a sinle ReactDOM.render() calling that var
        - faster, more popular
    -*multi-page application* = multiple HTML pages, content is rerendered on the server, not all content is in React components and there is a ReactDOM.render() per widget
